- ### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Ivars Plaudis - Lasmanis!

I'm a curious and fast self learner with strong communication skills. I've been on the end-user side of ERP programs and e-com for more than 4 years and that gives me a great understanding of how everything should work for the customer.

I've loved computers and games since childhood, so I decided to push myself out of the comfort zone and actually create something. I've always liked puzzles and solving problems, and now I'm living my childhood dream by creating solutions for practical problems through coding. Resolving a problem that has kept me awake is one of the best feelings ever and coding has given me this satisfaction.
